InnoStay

Description: Hotel_Management_System

InnoStay is a backend API for managing hotel room bookings, built with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. It includes user authentication (JWT), room inventory, bookings, payments, feedback, and notifications. The architecture separates controllers from a repository (DAL) layer and is fully unit-testable with both real in-memory repository tests and mocked controller tests.
